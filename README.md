You got the following widgets:

EasyCustomTextView
EasyCustomButton

Define them in the XML as you would any other widget, so <com.iheanyiekechukwu.android.escv.EasyCustomTextView />

Then you can set the typeface by declaring the following as such, "escv:typefaceName="Roboto-Light"", and that will set the typeface up for you. Hope this helps and makes things easier!
